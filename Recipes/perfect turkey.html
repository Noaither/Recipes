    <p>This a list of Directions you'll need</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Step 1</em>
            <p>
                Rub turkey inside and out with kosher salt; place in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Cover and refrigerate to allow turkey to soak in brine solution for 12 hours, or overnight.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Step 2</em>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the turkey; discard the brine mixture.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Step 3</em>
            <p>
                Brush turkey with 1/2 of the melted butter. Place breast-side down on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff turkey cavity with 1/2 the onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and bay leaf. Scatter remaining vegetables and
                thyme in the bottom of the roasting pan; pour white wine over vegetables.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Step 4</em>
            <p>
                Roast turkey in the preheated oven, uncovered, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Carefully turn turkey breast-side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with remaining butter. An instant-read
                thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </p>
